## What is AthenaJS?


AthenaJS is a component visualizer workshop that allows developers to quickly develop and edit their React 
components without codebase integration.  

**Easy to use**: AthenaJS is a standalone electron application that allows developers to import their
own React components or create components from scratch within the application's code editor.

**Dynamic**: Developers can mock fetch request/data, edit the state, props and functions of their components within the application's code editor. They will be able to see those changes reflected within the component visualizer.

**UI Mode**: After developers have created/edited their react components, they can navigate to the UI Mode section and create a mock UI from their saved component library.

##Features

### Developing a Component from Scratch

Using the Athena's workshop, developers can write, design, and create full, complete component features that are ready for use in your own app. The component view area features a complete staging area allowing you to view changes as soon as you add them.

###Upload and Edit Components

If you already have components made that you want to decouple and work on, you can access them from our file explorer  and pull them into Athena's workshop to edit them. Now you can change the component's state, props, functionality in the workshop without manipulating your app to see a specific state. Athena allows you to develop and mock ideas faster streamlining the workflow and production process.

### Mocking Server

If the component has server data dependencies that could affect its state, Athena can mock those as well. Living in a separate editor for ease of access, you can mock server data and have all the data dependencies organized for accelerated testing.
Compare Component Render Times
Curious which components are causing or have the potential to cause a bottleneck in your application? Every time you render a new component, the render time is captured using the React Profiler API, the same API that React Dev Tools are built on.  Render times can be added to a bar graph with the click of a button to easily compare render times across different components.

### UI Whiteboard

Once you build a component library, you can easily prototype UIs using the drag and drop UI whiteboard.  The whiteboard area can be saved as a screenshot to your downloads folder by pressing the screenshot button on the top right portion of the screen.   This is a great tool for prototyping a user interface and makes it easier to put your components together to create a cohesive UI within your application.
One of our favorite uses of this tool is to compare similar components.  Not sure which navbar or button you like best? Add them to the whiteboard and compare them side-by-side!
